# Python programming class

Most important is the newsfeed project, using News API to display news articles based on keywords and filters in a GUI.

This Python script uses the NewsAPI to fetch and display news articles based on selected filters such as language, country, category, or specific news sources. 

It builds a GUI using Tkinter to show the results in a scrollable window, with each article presented along with its title, description, source, author, date, URL, and optionally an image preview.

It also includes dictionaries to map Romanian names of languages, countries, categories, and news sources to the corresponding codes used by the API. The script handles errors (e.g., network issues or malformed data) and includes clickable links for full articles and images.
